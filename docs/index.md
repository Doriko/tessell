gwt-mpv
=======

Disclaimers
-----------

* The [view generation](./viewgeneration.html) is awesome
* The model (properties, rules, etc.) are pretty solid
* The server<->client is just gwt-dispatch command style (no fancy RequestFactory)

Download
--------

The latest release of gwt-mpv can be found in the joist maven repo:

* [http://repo.joist.ws](http://repo.joist.ws/)

E.g. see the [gwt-mpv-user](http://repo.joist.ws/org/gwtmpv/gwt-mpv-user/) directory.

Changes
-------

Following the [gwt-mpv github project](https://github.com/stephenh/gwt-mpv) is the best way to stay in the loop on changes.

Credits
-------

* [Bizo](http://www.bizo.com) for their initial and continued support of `gwt-mpv`
* [gwt-pectin](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-pectin/) inspired gwt-mpv's binding DSL, which was previously very ugly
