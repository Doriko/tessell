gwt-mpv
=======

Disclaimers
-----------

* The view generation is awesome
* The model (properties, rules, etc.) are coming along
* Presenter <-> Presenter communication/fades/etc. needs a lot of work, I have no good answers yet

Todo
----

* Port over `SuccessCallback`

Credits
-------

* [Bizo](http://www.bizo.com) for their initial and continued support of `gwt-mpv`
* [gwt-pectin](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-pectin/) inspired gwt-mpv's binding DSL, which was previously very ugly--pectin is much more mature than gwt-mpv, you should check it out
